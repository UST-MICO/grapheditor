## [Unreleased]

### Refactored

- Refactored text wrapping code to cause less dom updates

### Fixed

- Text wrapping only worked if the `text` tag also had a `text` css class. Now all `text` tags will be wrapped automatically.


## [0.6.0] - 2020-7-23

### Added

- Added ResizeManager that allows node resizing via api and drag and drop
- Added 'noderesize' event fired when resizing a node with the resize manager
- Added 'svginitialized' event when the grapheditor initializes a new svg
- Added methods `getSVG`, `getGraphGroup`, `getNodesGroup`, `getEdgesGroup`, `getEdgeSelection` and `getDraggedEdgeSelection` to grapheditor
- Added utility methods `removeAllChildNodes` and `copyTemplateSelectionIntoNode` n util to help working with static templates
- Added public `updateEdgeGroupClasses` to only update the classes of edges

### Fixed

- Fixed removeEdge not working with string ids
- Fixed cancelling 'edgeremove' event leaving the original edge with the `ghost` class until `completeRender` was called

- Fixed build errors when using the package in a typescript project

## [0.3.0] - 2019-11-22

**Known Issue:** this version was compiled using typescript 3.7!
The resulting `.d.ts` are **only** compatible with typescript versions `>= 3.6`. See [typescript 3.7 release notes](www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-7.html#class-field-mitigations) for more information.

### Fixed

- `attributePath` text components not working correctly

### Incompatible changes

- Removed templating using html templates (old template content can be reused)
- All link handles are now rendered using marker templates
- Changed `template-type` attribute of templates to `data-template-type`
- The `network-graph` tag can no longer be empty it must at least contain a `svg` tag for the `graph` slot

## [0.1.1] - 2019-06-22

### Added

- Use regex to determine word boundarys when wrapping text (before only spaces were valid word boundarys for texwrapping)
- Use [ResizeObserver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ResizeObserver) to detect resizes if available (if unavailable calculate current size before zooming to bounding box)
- New `edgedrop` event to enable creating nodes where an edge was dropped in the void
- Add `eventSource` to all custom events to distinguish events by how they were triggered (possible values: `INTERNAL`, `API`, `USER_INTERACTION`)
- Add `clickEventKey` attribute to `Marker` class (used to set `data-click` attribute in html)
- Click events `edgeclick` and `nodeclick` now search the whole path (only inside the specific svg group) for a `data-click` attribute to use as key
- Add textcomponents to edge to display text in an edge with text wrapping and drag behaviour for manual positioning
